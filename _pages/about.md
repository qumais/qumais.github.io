<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am serving as a Research Associate Professor at the School of Artificial Intelligence at Shenzhen Technology University since 2024.

I received a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) <img src='images/logo_ustc.png' style='width: 1.1em;'>, Hefei, in 2022. I served as a postdoctoral researcher in Biomedical Engineering at Shenzhen University and Shenzhen Technology University from 2022 to 2024. 

I have published 32 SCI journal and conference publications. I focuses on developing deep learning algorithms for high-resolution cancer cell imaging and AI-driven laser diagnostics, with applications in precision oncology. My research interests include:

- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing
- ⚕️ Medical Image Processing, Medical Image Segmentation
- ✴️ XUV, CDI, Laser Beam Optimization
